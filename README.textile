h1. Talk.org source code

This is a Twitter like application written in Python/Django for Google's AppEngine.

The live running version of this is on http://talk.org

Here is "The original Announcement for Talk.org is at":http://stakeventures.com/articles/2008/06/09/just-in-time-for-the-keynote-my-new-google-app-engine-twitter-clone-talk-org

I'll happily accept patches, suggestions etc.

I'm releasing my code under GPL v3 as this is the best license IMHO for Web Applications.

Of course this code builds on Django, Google and other libraries. In particular I used
"Wuzhere":http://code.google.com/p/wuzhere/ as the base for application structure etc.
